# Weather API Example

This PHP script fetches the location and temperature based on the visitor's IP address using ipinfo.io and OpenWeatherMap APIs.

## Usage

To use this API:

1. Ensure you have PHP installed on your web server.
2. Access the API endpoint with a `GET` request, providing the `visitor_name` parameter.

Example:
https://okozboy-weather.000webhostapp.com/api/?visitor_name=OKolaa


### Example Response

```json
{
    "client_ip": "192.168.1.1",
    "location": "New York",
    "temperature": "25",
    "greeting": "Hello, OKolaa! The temperature is 25 degrees Celsius in New York"
}

Notes:
. If the location or temperature cannot be determined, it will return "Unknown".
. Ensure to replace the $access_token and $api_key variables with your actual tokens from ipinfo.io and OpenWeatherMap for production use.
